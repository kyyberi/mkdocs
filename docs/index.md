# Maysano

## An Operating Layer for Data Products

Maysano is an operating layer for managing data products from strategy to execution. It connects business objectives, measurable outcomes, governance components, and implementation workflows into one coherent system.

Instead of treating data governance, delivery, and strategy as separate activities, Maysano brings them into the same structured model. Every data product is explicitly linked to business intent, measurable impact, and enforceable governance components.

## Why Maysano Exists

Many organizations struggle with:

- Data products disconnected from business objectives  
- Governance defined in documents but not enforced in execution  
- Quality and SLAs treated as reporting exercises instead of product commitments  
- AI features introduced without clear control boundaries  
- Versioning and change management handled inconsistently  

Maysano addresses this by turning product strategy and governance into structured, reusable, and versioned components.

## What Maysano Connects

Maysano aligns five core dimensions:

1. **Objectives**  
   Strategic goals defined at business level.

2. **Outcome KPIs**  
   Measurable indicators that show whether objectives are being achieved.

3. **Internal KPIs**  
   Operational indicators owned by data products.

4. **Data Products**  
   Versioned, governed, and measurable assets.

5. **Governance Components**  
   Reusable modules such as Data Quality (DQ), SLA, Access, and Pricing.

These are not separate documents. They are structurally linked.

## Product-First Governance

In Maysano, governance is not an afterthought. It is embedded into the product model.

Each data product:

- Has a defined purpose  
- Is linked to business objectives  
- Contains measurable KPIs  
- Uses reusable governance components  
- Is versioned and immutable once released  
- Operates within a human-in-control AI model  

This enables clarity, traceability, and accountability.

## Roles in Maysano

Maysano defines clear responsibility boundaries:

- **Product Manager** — owns product value and alignment to objectives  
- **Business Owner** — owns strategic intent and target outcomes  
- **Steward** — owns governance components and compliance models  
- **Admin** — maintains system configuration and integrations  

Each role has a defined focus area inside the platform.

## Governance as Structured Components

Governance elements such as:

- Data Quality (DQ)  
- Service Level Agreements (SLA)  
- Access Policies  
- Pricing Plans  

are reusable components from a Governance Library. They are attached to products instead of rewritten for each one.

This reduces inconsistency and improves scalability.

---

## AI in Maysano

AI assists in:

- Drafting structured components  
- Reviewing configuration quality  
- Suggesting improvements  
- Supporting workflow acceleration  

AI does not override human decisions. Humans remain accountable for approval, release, and governance.

---

## Versioning and Immutability

Once a data product version is released to production:

- It becomes immutable  
- Changes require a new version  
- Governance commitments remain traceable  

This protects architectural integrity and long-term maintainability.

---

## Designed for Modern Data Organizations

Maysano supports organizations that:

- Treat data products as business assets  
- Require structured governance  
- Operate in regulated environments  
- Want AI assistance without losing control  
- Need traceable alignment between strategy and execution
